# Hybrid_FraudDetection_Diffusion_XGBoost
A hybrid fraud detection system combining diffusion models for anomaly scoring and XGBoost for supervised verification. Trains a diffusion model on normal transactions, detects anomalies via reconstruction error, and refines predictions with a supervised XGBoost classifier to maximize precision and recall.
